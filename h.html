        <h1>In Flanders Field
            <p style="color:blue;">In Flanders fields the poppies grow
Between the crosses, row on row,
That mark our place, and in the sky,
The larks, still bravely singing, fly,
<h1 style="color:red;"> heard amid the guns below.</h1></p>

<p style="color:pink;">We are the dead; short days ago
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,
Loved and were loved, and now we lie
In Flanders fields.</p>

<h1 style="color:red;"> up our quarrel with the foe!</h1>
<p style="color:green;">To you from failing hands we throw
The torch; be yours to hold it high!
If ye break faith with us who die</p>
<h1 style="color:red;">We shall not sleep, though poppies grow
In Flanders fields.</h1>
