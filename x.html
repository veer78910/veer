    <h1>My interest</h1>
        <ol>
<li>Intramural sports leagues — you’re outside, active, and around other single people. Tennis, ping pong, soccer, kickball, softball, basketball, flag football, and more are options.</li>
<li>Landscaping or gardening — getting your hands dirty, working up a sweat, and then grabbing a beer feels good connecting with nature.</li>
<li>Working on cars — whether the one you have or the one you’re restoring an old vehicle, it’s a manly hobby. No matter what, you need to know how to change a tire, use jumper cables, and change the oil in your car.</li>
<li>Anything outdoorsy and active — hiking and camping allow you to be amongst nature, which can be rejuvenating and revitalizing.</li>
<li>Reading and writing — education and building your brain is incredibly masculine. You can also listen to a podcast to consume knowledge. Writing can be pleasurable, a creative outlet, or for a goal.</li>
<li>Riding an ATV — dirt bikes, motorcycles, three or four-wheelers, or golf carts with knobby tires are all masculine fun.</li>
<li>Cooking or grilling — there’s nothing more masculine than grilling a piece of meat.</li>
<li>Exercising or working out — anything active outside is good hobby for the body and soul. Many fitness facilities have a community feel, which is a great way to get active and connect with other amazing people like yourself.</li>
